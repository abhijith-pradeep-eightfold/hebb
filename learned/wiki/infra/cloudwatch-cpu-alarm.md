# CloudWatch CPU alarm + EC2 metric access

**Summary:** How to pull a CloudWatch **alarm definition** and the underlying **EC2 `CPUUtilization`** timeseries from the agent environment, using read-only AWS CLI calls. This is the access pattern for confirming a "Solr CPU Util Too High" PagerDuty alarm (see [[../solr/solr-collection-topology|Solr collection topology]]) against the real metric curve.

## Environment / reachability

The agent box has the AWS CLI and a usable us-west-2 profile:

- AWS CLI present (`aws-cli/1.40.37`, `botocore/1.38.38`).
- `AWS_PROFILE=bedrock-role`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=948299231917`; `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` both present.
- The `bedrock-role` profile **could** read CloudWatch in us-west-2 (no `AccessDenied` on `describe-alarms` / `get-metric-statistics`). Whether a role holds `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` / `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` is **not** knowable from env inspection alone — it can only be confirmed by an actual call. Check reachability by making the read and reporting plainly if it is denied.

These are **telemetry reads**, not writes — run them unattended. Reachability is only knowable by trying: make the read and report plainly if it is denied.

## Step 0 — if you start from DNS (no alarm in hand)

If you reached this point via a `search_config` DNS lookup (see [[../solr/solr-shard-dns-lookup|Solr shard DNS lookup via search_config]]) rather than a PagerDuty alarm, you need to resolve the DNS hostname to an EC2 InstanceId before pulling CloudWatch metrics:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2 \
  --filters "Name=dns-name,Values=<ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com>" \
  --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text
```

- Run once per replica DNS hostname. The result (`i-...`) feeds directly into Step 2 below.
- If you *do* have an alarm name, skip this step — the alarm definition in Step 1 already carries the `InstanceId` dimension.
- This is also the path for a **plain current-state question** ("what is the CPU of `<collection>` shard `<N>` right now?") with no incident or alarm behind it: resolve the InstanceIds, **skip Step 1 (`describe-alarms`) entirely**, and go straight to the Step 2 timeseries. Report each replica per [[../solr/solr-collection-topology|topology]] — a shard's CPU is per-replica. (Confirmed on positions shard 2: both replicas ~5% Average, no alarm firing.) For this collection+shard case the `solr-shard-cpu` skill runs the whole pipeline in one call — see the [[skills/index|Skills catalog]].

## Step 1 — the alarm definition

```bash
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --region us-west-2 \
  --alarm-name-prefix "[us-west-2] P1 Solr CPU Util Too High on profiles shard 21"
```

A single Solr alarm-name prefix can match **multiple** sibling alarms (one per replica). The observed "profiles shard 21" prefix returned two — replica 0 and replica 1 — each carrying its own `InstanceId` dimension (see [[../solr/solr-collection-topology|topology]] for the host↔InstanceId table). The alarm config (both replicas identical):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `MetricName` | `CPUUtilization` |
| `Namespace` | `AWS/EC2` |
| `Statistic` | `Average` |
| `Threshold` | `75.0` |
| `ComparisonOperator` | `GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold` |
| `Period` | `300` (s) |
| `EvaluationPeriods` | `6` |
| `DatapointsToAlarm` | `5` |
| `TreatMissingData` | `breaching` |
| `AlarmActions` | SNS `errors_volkscience_com` + PagerDuty |

So the alarm fires when CPU is **≥ 75% Average for 5 of any 6 consecutive 300s periods** — it tolerates one low datapoint, and missing data counts as breaching. This is why the page fired ~30 min into the spike, not at its onset (5×300s = 25 min of breach must accrue).

The alarm's **`StateReasonData`** records the most recent transition: the queried transition time (e.g. ALARM→OK at `2026-06-15T08:51:59Z`) and the `recentDatapoints` array (300s, Average) that drove it — useful to confirm the breach window without a separate metric pull.

> The alarm's last-transition time is **not** a proxy for "currently healthy/quiet": replica 1 ran hotter than replica 0 yet its alarm last transitioned 2025-09-15 (config only updated 2026-06-23). Read the metric, not just the alarm state.

## Step 2 — the CPU timeseries

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --region us-west-2 \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<i-...> \
  --start-time 2026-06-15T06:00:00Z --end-time 2026-06-15T12:00:00Z \
  --period 60 --statistics Average Maximum
```

- The dimension is the **`InstanceId`** (from the alarm definition), not the hostname.
- Pull a few hours either side of the suspected spike; `--period 60` gives one-minute buckets; request both `Average` and `Maximum`.
- The raw JSON is unordered — sort by `Timestamp` locally before reading it. (A scratch sort/tabulate step that flags `Average ≥ threshold` buckets is enough; no `$CODE_BASE` import is involved.)

Observed for the alarming host (replica 0) over the 6h band: 72 one-minute Average buckets, mean ~31%, with a contiguous **08:20–08:35 UTC** block at ~98–99% Average (max ~99.7) — a genuine sustained breach, not a one-minute blip.

**Average vs. Maximum — read the right statistic.** The alarm evaluates **Average**, so that is the breach signal; **Maximum** is a per-bucket peak that can momentarily hit ~100% without lifting the Average, and on its own is **not** a breach. Witnessed on `profiles` shard 21 (2026-06-29, current-state pull): hourly Average stayed ~5% (mean 5.15%, max 17%) across 24h with **0** buckets ≥ 75%, even though per-minute Maximum within an hour spiked to 99.77% (then 68%, 60%, 53%) — short peaks that left the Average low. Report both, but judge breach on the Average; a lone high Maximum is normal.

## Timezone — CloudWatch is UTC

CloudWatch metric and alarm timestamps are **UTC**. (The PagerDuty console may *display* the page time in IST — e.g. 14:22 IST = 08:52 UTC, IST = UTC + 5:30 — but that is a console-rendering detail; the underlying metric is UTC.)

When correlating against [[../data-warehouse/search-query-log|log.search_query_log]], its `t_create` is also stored in **UTC** (so is `processor_event_log.t_create`) — the two are on the **same clock; no shift is needed**.
